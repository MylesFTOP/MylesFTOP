### Hi there! 👋

I'm Myles (he/him). I write primarily in C# (with xUnit and Coverlet/[Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/MylesFTOP) helping make sure I don't break what I've made), and am currently working on several projects to help me develop my skills.

Some of my recent projects:
* **TicketSystem** - a test project simulating parts and task management for field engineers. Written using .NET Core 3.1.
* **PlayersToolkitFor13thAge** - a project to develop a character sheet manager and general players' toolkit for the tabletop RPG _13th Age_. Written using .NET Framework 4.7.2, initially using WinForms for a desktop implementation, with [Tim Corey's C# course](https://youtu.be/wfWxdh-_k_4) as a framework for the initial design of the desktop application.
* **LuhnCheck** - a small programme to check input strings using the Luhn algorithm. Written using .NET Framework 4.7.2, looking to port it to .NET Core 3.1.

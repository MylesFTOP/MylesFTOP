### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Myles (he/him). I write primarily in C# (with xUnit helping make sure I don't break what I've made), and am currently working on several projects to help me develop my skills.

Some of my recent projects:
- **TicketSystem**   - a test project simulating parts and task management for field engineers.
- **PlayersToolkitFor13thAge** - a project to develop a character sheet manager and general players' toolkit for the tabletop RPG _13th Age_.
- **LuhnCheck** - a small programme to check input strings using the Luhn algorithm.

### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Myles (he/him). I write primarily in C# (with xUnit helping make sure I don't break what I've made), and am currently working on several projects to help me develop my skills.

Some of my recent projects:
- **TicketSystem** ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/MylesFTOP/TicketSystem/.NET%20Core) - a test project simulating parts and task management for field engineers.
- **PlayersToolkitFor13thAge** ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/MylesFTOP/PlayersToolkitFor13thAge/.NET%20Core)- a project to develop a character sheet manager and general players' toolkit for the tabletop RPG _13th Age_.
- **LuhnCheck** ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/MylesFTOP/LuhnCheck/.NET%20Core) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/MylesFTOP/LuhnCheck/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/MylesFTOP/LuhnCheck) - a small programme to check input strings using the Luhn algorithm.
